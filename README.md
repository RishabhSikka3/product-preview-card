## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first responsive design
- BEM naming convention
- Google Fonts: Montserrat & Fraunces (`font-display: swap`)

### What I learned

During this challenge, I learned:

- How to use the `<picture>` element for responsive images.
- The difference between using `srcset` and `<picture>`.
- That fixed heights should be avoided on cards or containers when content size might vary.
- How to use `object-fit: cover` and `align-self: stretch` to make images fill grid cells properly.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Further explore accessibility and semantic HTML best practices
- Explore container queries for layout control.
- Improve accessibility by ensuring keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
- Improve image loading with loading="lazy" and decoding="async".
